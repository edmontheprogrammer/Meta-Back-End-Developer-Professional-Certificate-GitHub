# Namespacing and Scoping:
#
# Python Scope:
# 1. Local
# 2. Enclosed
# 3. Global
# 4. Built-in ##

# Note 1: There are two keywords that can be used to change the scope
# of variables "global" and "non-local" .
#
# global keyword:
# The global keyword helps us access the global variables from within
# the function.
#
# "non-local" keyword:
#
# "non-local" is a special type of scope defined in Python that is
# used within the nested functions only in the condition that has
# been defined earlier in the enclosed functions.
