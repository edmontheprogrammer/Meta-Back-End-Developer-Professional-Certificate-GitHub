# In this exercise, you will practice the use of an algorithm to make a cup of insstance coffee. The purose
# is to lay out the steps in order to get the final product
#
# Instructions:
#
# Step1: Start with the input - what is needed to make a cup of instance coffee?
#
# Step 2: Think about all the steps required in the physical aspect of making a cup of instance coffee
#
# Step 3: Consider the edge cases of optional things like milk or sugar, some peole may want it.
#
# Step 4: The algorithm when complete should have its final result a cup of coffee.
#
# Tips: Planning is key with any algorithm. Make sure you have all the steps neatly laid out.##

# There are four steps in solving any coding problem
#
# Step 1: Understand the problem. This is you writing the problem in a simple plain English to demonstrate
#           that you understand it. Basically, you need to write a program or a function that will make
#       a cupe of instance coffee. Basically, you'll write a program that will create a cup of coffee
#       with all the steps that goes into making a coffee by code.
#
#       Understanding the problem part 1: What are the inputs?
#           Start with the inputs - what is needed to make a cup of instant coffee?
#
#           // cofeeMaker(hot_water, instance_coffe_powder, cup, spoon)
#
#
#       Understanding the problem part 2: What are the outputs?
#         //  cofeeMaker(hot_water, instance_coffe_powder, cup, spoon) -> cup_of_coffee
#
# Step 2: Write the pesudocode for the problem. This is a step by step instructions in English explaining
#        how you will solve the problem.
#
#           // Create a function name "cofeeMaker" that will accepts these variables as input parameters
#           // hot_water, instance_coffe_powder, cup, spoon
#
#           // assign the variable "cup" to a list that repersents a coffee cup
#
#           // store the "hot_water" and "instance_coffee_power" in the cup
#
#           // create an operation that repersents mixing with a spoon that produces an instance coffee
#
#           // return "cup_of_coffee" from the function.
#
#
#
#
# Step 3: Implement the solution (Solve the problem!). This is taking the pesudocodes in step 2 and
#           solving the actual problem in code.
#
# Step 4: Revision. Look back at the solution you implmented and try to improve the code. Optimize, write
#       test cases and write "edge cases" if you have time.  ##


# Step 3: Implement the solution (Solve the problem!). This is taking the pesudocodes in step 2 and
#           solving the actual problem in code.


# * Make a cup of coffee - suggested solution:
#
# Solution algorithm:
#
# Input:
#
#   Ingredients required:
#       * Cup
#       * Hot water
#       * Coffee granules
#
#   Optional:
#       * Milk
#       * Cream
#       * Sugar
#
#   Output:
#       * A cup of coffee.
#
#   Steps:
#       1. Add drinking water to an electric kettle.
#       2. Put the kettle on the boil water
#       3. While waiting, prepare coffee.
#           * 4. Add coffee granules on the cup
#           * 5. If water is boiled, pour water into a cup, else continue
#                   to wait.
#       6. If milk or cream is required, add and stir
#       7. If sugar is required, add and stir
#       8. Return coffee ##
