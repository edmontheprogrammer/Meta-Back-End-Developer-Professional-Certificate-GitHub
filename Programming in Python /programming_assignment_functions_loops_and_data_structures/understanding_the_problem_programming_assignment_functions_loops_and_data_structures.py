# 	There are four steps to the problem-solving method:
    # * Step 1: Understand the problem
    # * Step 2: Create a plan in Pseudocode
    # * Step 3: Implement the Plan in Code (Solve the problem)
    # * Step 4: Look Back and Make Revisions of How You Solved the Problem 
#
# Step 1: Understand the Problem: 
#   
#  Programming Assignment: Functions, Loops, and Data Structures:
# 
#  Introduction: 
# 
#  In this lab you will be presented with a menu ordering system which will allow users 
#  to input three choices for a select menu. You are tasked with completing the menu 
#  system so that it returns and calculates the final bill for the user. 
# 
# Objectives: 
#  * Create new functions to solve specific problems
#  * Gain experince of using for loops to iterate over different data collections. 
#  * Create and use data structures to store, retrieve and loop over data. 
# 
# Instructions: 

# Step 1: Open the script ordering_system.py present inside the project folder.

# Step 2: Run the script and, when requested, enter in the 
# three products of your choice based on the 
# menu - 1 = espresso, 2 = coffee etc.

# Step 3: To run the script, open the terminal and
#  execute the command below.
# 
# Step 4: Extend the script to have a function called "calculate_subtotal"
# It shoud accept one argument which is the order list and return the sum 
# of the prices of the items in the order list##
