# Test-dreven development (TDD):
#
# Test-driven development or TDD is a form of development where you write the test first,
# and then the code, so that the tests will pass.
#
# Test-driven Development (TDD) follows this approach:
#
# Step 1:
#   Write a test for a feature that fails.
#
# Step 2:
#   Write code in accordance with the tests.
#
# Step 3:
#   Run the tests expecting them to fail
#
# Step 4:
#   Evaluate the error and refactor the code as needed.
#
# Step 5:
#   Rerrun the process.
#
# This process is also called the RED-Green-Refactor cycle.
#   * Red implies the failed tests
#   * Green implies the passing tests 
# 
# * Use pytest for tasting 'cause it's easier to start with. 
# 
# * Advantages of Test-driven Development TDD: 
#   1. Writing tests first 
#   2. Forecasting and clear from start
#   3. integrating components
#   4. Ease to refactor ##
#
# * Differences Between TDD and traditional testing: 
#   1. TDD Requirements and standards are highlighted from the beginning
