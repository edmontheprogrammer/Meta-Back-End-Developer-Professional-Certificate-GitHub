# Introduction:
#
#   If you set up your full stack development environment with the right tools, you can use your time more effectively
# during the development process. By using effective tools, you can make the development process fast and anf fun. This
# reading will introduce you to some essential tools for full stack development.
#
# The terminal:
#
#   In full stack development, you must familiarze yourself with using terminals and command-line tools. This is where you
# can run commands to build Django projects. manage builds and communicate with your server and the database. If you are
# not using the terminal, you can't use Django, install the dependencies or use JavaScript to properly build tools.
# In macOS and Linux, you can use the app called terminal and in Windows, you use PowerShell for this purpose.
#
# Django specific tools:
#
#   By now you should know that when using Django your project, it's always a good idea to avoid using global envionments
# to manage your package dependencies. Pipenv is a fantastic command line tool that only manages your dependencies but also
# does so in a virtual environment, avoiding any possible conflicts between the packages. Download it from the
# Pipenv Website.
#
# Database:
#
#   While Django can use SQLite, a file-based database system, it can work with many others. And MySQL and MariaDB are
# some of the most popular and widely used database engines by developers worldwide. You can install MySQL on your machine
# using the installer from their website or using the package managers available for your operating system.
#
#  Editor:
#
#   A good code editor can really speed up your development by providing essential features like debuggers, quick
# refactoring and syntax highlighting. Additionally there are many adds-ons or extensions that you can install which
# provide even more functionalities. Visual Studio Code is a great editor that has everything you need to start
# developing in different programming languages. And the best part is, it's free. Download VS code from Microsoft's website.
#
# API testing:
#
#   To test the APIs that you build, you need a REST API client to make different API calls and send JSON or form URL
# encoded payloads and headers. Postman, Isomnia, and HTTpie are three popular REST clients you can use for free.
# They are cross-platform and very user-friendly. Here are a few useful links to get you started with API testing
#
# * Postman API platform for building and using APIs
# * Postman Echo service to test REST clients and make sample API calls
# * Insomnia homepage
# * Getting started with Insomnia
# * Httpbin HTTP request and response service
#
# * Version Control:
#   An effective verison control system is a must-have for any full stack developer. Using a version control system like a
# "Git", you can maintain different version of your code and you can also roll back to any particular state in the past
# at any time. Fortunately, these days version control systems are integrated with the build tools.
#
# Front-End Tools:
#   When using front-end frameworks like React, you need Node.js installed on your system to access it from the command line
# You also need a package manager like NPM or Yarn to deal with the dependencies and a build tool like "Vite.jsor"
# "Webpack" to build the produciton version of your code. These days, Vite is a popular and fast building tool you can use
# for free.
#
#  Conclusion:
#
#  With the proper development environment, you can make your development journey really enjoyable and productive.
# The correct tools help you write quality code fast and avoid common errors. In this reading, you learned what tools you
# should have in your toolbelt to become an excellent full stack developer.  ##
