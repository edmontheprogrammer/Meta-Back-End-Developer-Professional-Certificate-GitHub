# Setting up tools and environment:
#
#   Introduction:
#
# Before you can start an API project you need to have the right setup on your computer. In this reading, you will learn
# how to configure necessary extensions in VS Code. You will also learn how to use pipenv to manage the packages and the
# virtual environment for your API projects.
#
# Step 1: Install VS Code.
#
# Step 2: Install Python
#
# Step 3: Install the VS Code Python extension:
#
#   Open VS code and access the extensions panel from the view menu, the left sidebar or by pressing "Command, Shift and X"
# Search for Python and select the first one from Microsoft. This extension provides features like syntax highlighting,
# autosuggestions, debugging, and linting, which makes it very useful for Python developers.
#
# Step 4: Install additional VS Code extensions (Optional)
#
# You can also install a few other useful VS Code extensions for Python Development. Search for "Python indent" by
# Kevin Rosee to correct Python indentation in VS Code, and "Djangoerio" by Scott Barkman for useful Django snippets.
#
# Step 5: Install a package manager:
#
#    Next, you need to install pipenv, a package manager for Python application from "pipenv.pypa.io". pipenv lets you
# easily create virtual enviornments for your projects so that you can manage your depedencies more efficiently. This
# allows you to stinall packages for your projects without conflicting with other versions of the same package used by
# other projects.
#
# To install pipenv, open your terminal or PowerShell and type the following command:
#
# pip3 install pipenv
#
# Conclusion:
#
#   You should be set up to start your first Django API project using Python. You now know how to install the latest version
# of Python, the Python extension and other useful extensions in VS Code as well as the package manager pipenv. ##
