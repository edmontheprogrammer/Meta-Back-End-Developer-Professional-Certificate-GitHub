# API throttling for class-based views
#
# Introduciton:
#
# You already learned about the basics of rate limiting or throttling earlier in the course. But, in this reading, you will
# learn how to quickly implement throttling in a class-based views. You will also learn about how some real-world
# services use this API throttling to protect their API endpoints from abuse.
#
# Project Scaffolding:
#
#  Use a class-based view to extend the "ModelViewSet" to quickly implement a functional CRUD API endpoint for the menu
# items. To create this class-based view add these lines in the "views.py" file.  ##
from . import views
from django.urls import path
from .throttles import TenCallsPerMinute
from rest_framework.throttling import UserRateThrottle, AnonRateThrottle
from rest_framework.response import Response from rest_framework import viewsets from .models import MenuItem from .serializers import MenuItemSerializer


class MenuItemsViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):


                queryset = MenuItem.objects.all()
                serializer_class = MenuItemSerializer

# Open the "urls.py" file and map this "MenuItemViewSet" class to the "menu-items" API endpoint. Map only the "GET" methods.
#  ##
urlpatterns = [
    path('menu-items', views.MenuItemsViewSet.as_view({'get': 'list'})),
                path('menu-items/<int:pk>', views.MenuItemsViewSet.as_view({'get': 'retrieve'})),
]

# Now you can list all menu items by visiting "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/menu-items" and any single menu item by visiting
# "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/menu-items/1"
#
# Add support for throttling:
#
#   DRF comes with excellent throttling classes that you can use straight out of the box. To do this, add the following lines
# in the "settings.py" in the "REST_FRAMEWORK" section.   ##
'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES': [
                                'rest_framework.throttling.AnonRateThrottle',
                                'rest_framework.throttling.UserRateThrottle'
],

# Now you can implement throttling in your API project.
#
# Throttling for class-based views:
#
# Class-based views don't the the "throttle_classes" decorator like function-based views. To use throttling, you need to
# pass the throttle classes to public class property called throttle_classes. First import the necessary classes in the
# "views.py" file.   ##

# Then create a public property called "throttle_classes" with either one or both of these two classes, "UserRateThrottle"
# or "AnonRateThrottle" ##


class MenuItemsViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):


                throttle_classes = [AnonRateThrottle, UserRateThrottle]
                queryset = MenuItem.objects.all()
                serializer_class = MenuItemSerializer

#  Now the "menu-items" API endpoints will be throttled for both anonymous and authenticated users. You can define the
# throttling rate for both in the "settings.py" file. If you want to limit the API calls to 5 per minute for anonymous
#  users and 10 per minute for authenticate users, then add the following lines in the "REST_FRAMEWORK" section, as
# you learned in a previous video.  ##
'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES': {
                                'anon': '2/minute',
                                'user': '10/minute'
}

# To test if the throttling is working properly, go to the "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/menu-items" endpoint three times.
# After the second visit, the client will see an error message.
#
# API users with a valid token will see the same message after 10 successful calls to this endpoint.
#
# Conditional throttling:
#
#   It's very easy to implement conditional thorttling a class-based views. With conditional throttling, you can throttle
# API endpoints only for the specific HTTP methods, like "GET" calls, or "POST" calls.
#
# For example, you can have conditional thorttling that throttles "POST" calls, but not "GET" calls. You can do this by
# overriding the "get_throttles" methods. In a class-based view that extends a "ModelViewSet" class, the "POST" call is
# handled by "create" methods. Similarly, the "GET" call is handled by the "list" method. Add the following lines of code
# to implement conditional throttling in the "MenuItemsViewSet" class.  ##


class MenuItemsViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):


                queryset = MenuItem.objects.all()
                serializer_class = MenuItemSerializer
 
                 def get_throttles(self):
                                 if self.action == 'create':
                                                throttle_classes = [UserRateThrottle]
                                 else:
                                                throttle_classes = []
                                 return [throttle() for throttle in throttle_classes]

# Note: The "throttle_classes" is not used as a public attribute this time, which means the following line from the
# previous code example was removed.  ##
throttle_classes = [AnonRateThrottle, UserRateThrottle]

# Instead, this checks if the router called the "create" action, which handles the "POST" request. If that action is called,
# implement the throttling class "UserRateThrottle". The "POST" calls will be limited to 10 calls per minute to this
# "menu-items" endpoint.
#
# Cutom throttling classes:
#
#   You can use the cutom throttling classes you created in the course, like "TenCallsPerMinute" in the "throttles.py"
# file. All you have to do is import this class and then add it in the "throttle_classes" attribute, and you are done.  ##

# And then
throttle_classes = [TenCallsPerMinute]

# Real World examples of API rate limits:
#
#   Here are some popular services and their current rate limit. This can hel you get some idea of how others are using
# such features in their API projects.
#
#   Service                     Anonymous               Authenticated
#
#   Facebook graph API              X                       200/hour
#   Instagram API                   X                       200/hour
#   Instagram messenger API         X                       100/second
#   WhatsApp messaging API          X                       80/second
#
# Conclusion:
#
#   In this reading, you learned how to implement throttling in class-based views and also how to create conditional
#   throttling.  ##
