# Forking: 
# 
# In previous lessons, you have touched on workflows such as branching and how they can be used to
# simplify a process for a team. Forking is another type of workflow. The key difference between branching
# and forking is that the workflow for forking creates a new repository. Branching cuts a new branch from
# the same repository each time and each member of the team works on the single repository.
# 
# Let's take a simple example of how forking works. In the diagram below the coolgame repo has been forked
# by Joe. The entire contents and the hisotry of the repository are now stored in Joe's account on GitHub.
# Joe is now free to make edits and changes to the repository at his own will. You, the ownser of the
# coolgame repository can continue to work as normal and not know about Joe's edit or changes. 
# 
# Joe created a new branch on his repository and added a new cool feature that he felt was needed. In order
# for Joe to get his feature back into the original repository, he will need to create a PR as normal but
# instead of comparing with the main branch, it needs to be compared with the original repository. 
# Essentially the two repositories are compared against each other. The owner of the original repository
# can then reivew the PR and choose to accept of decline the new feature.
